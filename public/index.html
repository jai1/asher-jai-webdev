                            Developed a derivative of Unix FFS filesystem using the FUSE toolkit in Linux. The
                            FileSystem was implemented as a user-space process i.e instead of a physical disk we used a
                            data file which was accessed through a block device interface specified at the end of this
                            file.

                        The goal of this assignment was to familiarize us with the low-level operations of the Internet protocol stack. Working above the operating system's networking stack hides all the underlying complexity of creating and managing IP and TCP headers our task was to write a program called rawhttpget that takes a URL on the command line and downloads the associated file using an SOCK_RAW/IPPROTO_RAW socket, which means building the IP and TCP headers in each packet. In essence, you will be rebuilding the operating system's TCP/IP stack within your application.

                        We used used Python to acheive the task and for extra credit we also rebuild the Datalink layer for Ethernet.

                        This assignment was intended to familiarize us with the HTTP protocol. HTTP is (arguably) the most important application level protocol on the Internet today: the Web runs on HTTP, and increasingly other applications use HTTP as well (including Bittorrent, streaming video, Facebook and Twitter's social APIs, etc.).
                        <br/>
                        A web crawler (sometimes known as a robot, a spider, or a screen scraper) is a piece of software that automatically gathers and traverses documents on the web. For example, lets say you have a crawler and you tell it to start at www.wikipedia.com. The software will first download the Wikipedia homepage, then it will parse the HTML and locate all hyperlinks (i.e. anchor tags) embedded in the page. The crawler then downloads all the HTML pages specified by the URLs on the homepage, and parses them looking for more hyperlinks. This process continues until all of the pages on Wikipedia are downloaded and parsed.
                        <br/>
                        Web crawlers are a fundamental component of today's web. For example, Googlebot is Google's web crawler. Googlebot is constantly scouring the web, downloading pages in search of new and updated content. All of this data forms the backbone of Google's search engine infrastructure.<br/>

                        The original design of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) worked reliably, but was unable to provide acceptable performance in large and congested networks. Several TCP variants have been proposed since then (TCP Tahoe, Reno, NewReno, Vegas, BIC, CUBIC, SACK, and others) with mechanisms to control and avoid congestion. The objective of this project is for to analyze the performance of these different TCP variants. Use the NS-2 network simulator to perform experiments that will help understand the behavior of the TCP variants under various load conditions and queuing algorithms.
